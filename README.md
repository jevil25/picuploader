# picuploader

This webpage allows you to login and upload your pictures in it.
This is based on the concept of google drive.
you can download the images too.
This uses image based64 encoding to save images.
I have used html,css,javscript,bootstrap,animate css for the frontend part.
i have used nodejs and mongodb for the backend part.

you can clone the project using command line
# git clone https://github.com/jevil25/picuploader.git
# cd picuploader
# nodemon server.js

Thank you
